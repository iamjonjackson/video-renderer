# video-renderer

Declarative video generation pipeline: describe scenes in a JSON spec, get an
MP4 with animated visuals and Mistral TTS (Voxtral) voiceover.

## How it works

1. You provide a **spec** (JSON) — a timeline of scenes with text, charts,
   images, and optional narration.
2. The renderer synthesizes narration per scene via the Mistral TTS API,
   probes each clip's duration, and sizes each scene to its audio
   (audio-driven timeline). Explicit `duration` overrides when you want a
   scene to linger.
3. MoviePy composites the scenes with animations and encodes the final MP4.

## Running locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamjonjackson/video-renderer.git
cd video-renderer
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install moviepy matplotlib imageio-ffmpeg pillow python-pptx

cp .env.example .env     # then edit .env and add your MISTRAL_API_KEY
set -a; source .env; set +a   # load env vars (or use dotenv in your shell)

# Final videos go to ./output, intermediate render files to ./temp
python3 src/render.py samples/sample-spec.json -o output/demo.mp4
```

Notes:

- `.env` is gitignored; `.env.example` documents the variables.
- `output/` (final videos) and `temp/` (TTS/image caches, intermediate
  artifacts) are gitignored except their `.gitkeep` placeholders.
- Without `MISTRAL_API_KEY`, scenes render silently and AI image blocks are
  skipped with a warning — the pipeline never hard-fails on missing AI.
- System ffmpeg is used if installed; otherwise `imageio-ffmpeg` bundles one.

## Frame: local visual Studio

Studio adds a Material-inspired storyboard editor without changing the CLI.
Use Python 3.12 with the dependencies above, then run:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python src/studio.py
```

Open **<http://127.0.0.1:8765>** or **<http://localhost:8765>** on the
computer running Studio. Browser-saved projects are separate for each address.
Use `--port 8766` if that port is occupied. Studio is local-only, not a
production server or a hosted collaboration service.

- Edit title, bullet, chart and outro scenes; add, delete and reorder them.
- Choose scenes in the single storyboard list. The header's appearance button
  switches the interface between light and dark with a circular reveal; the
  preference is saved separately from video styling. Reduced-motion preferences
  and browsers without View Transitions use an immediate switch.
- Change the video background/accent, import/export JSON, and restore the last
  project from this browser's local storage. Export JSON before replacing a
  project or clearing browser storage; imports replace the current project.
- The canvas is an **approximate layout preview**, not a live MoviePy render.
  Long text may clip in the final video; inspect the rendered result. Line/pie
  charts are represented by a labelled data preview, not an exact chart.
- Render an actual **silent MP4 and PPTX** with download links. Narration stays
  in authored/exported JSON but is removed from the render copy. Inherited
  provider credentials are excluded; Studio makes no AI calls. Timing uses
  explicit scene durations, unlike narration-driven CLI renders.
- Up to 12 scenes, 60 seconds total, 1–15 seconds per scene, fixed 1080p,
  24/30 fps. Image scenes/AI image blocks and unsupported fields are rejected;
  use the CLI for those features. The upstream sample includes an AI image
  block, so it is not directly importable into this bounded editor.
- One render at a time, three-minute deadline and ten renders per server
  session. Outputs use private temporary directories, removed on shutdown;
  download them before stopping Studio. Refreshing reconnects to the latest
  job. A failed PPTX export is reported separately from a successful video.

UI typography uses the operating system's sans-serif font (including Apple's
system font on macOS) without redistributing SF Compact. Final video rendering
continues to use the CLI's DejaVu Sans. No web-font CDN or frontend build is
needed. The existing CLI and AI integrations are unchanged.

Run the Studio checks:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
node --check studio/app.js
```

### GitHub Actions

A `Render test` workflow runs on PRs: renders `samples/sample-spec.json`
using the `MISTRAL_API_KEY` repo secret and uploads the MP4 as an artifact.

## Spec format (summary)

```json
{
  "meta":  { "fps": 30 },
  "theme": { "preset": "dark", "accent": "#58a6ff" },
  "voice": { "slug": "gb_jane_neutral" },
  "timeline": [
    { "type": "title",  "text": "Quarterly Review", "narration": "..." },
    { "type": "bullets", "heading": "Key Wins", "items": ["...", "..."] },
    { "type": "chart",  "chart_type": "bar", "labels": ["Jul","Aug","Sep"],
                        "values": [410, 455, 512], "narration": "..." },
    { "type": "image",  "src": "assets/slide.png", "anim": "kenburns" },
    { "type": "outro",  "text": "Thank you" }
  ]
}
```

- **Scene types**: `title`, `bullets`, `chart` (bar/line/pie), `image`, `outro`
- **Animations**: `fade`, `slide-up`, `zoom-in`, `kenburns` (images)
- **PPTX export**: every render also emits a `.pptx` alongside the MP4 —
  one slide per scene, built from the same artifacts (narration WAVs
  embedded on their slides, chart PNGs, generated images). Open in
  PowerPoint, tweak, and export to video from there for a near-identical
  result.
- **AI-generated images** (optional, any scene): add an `image` block —

```json
"image": {
  "prompt": "minimal isometric illustration of a rocket launch, deep blue palette",
  "placement": "background"   // "background" (faded, behind text) or
                               // "left" / "right" (spotlight panel beside text)
  "opacity": 0.25,             // background mode: image fade level
  "model": "mistral-medium-latest" // optional agent model override
}
```

For `background` placement the renderer measures WCAG contrast of the text
area against the composited backdrop and raises the scrim opacity until
AA (≥ 4.5:1) is met. If the target can't be reached even at maximum scrim,
the render continues with a warning (best-effort) — it never aborts.
`left`/`right` placements keep text on the solid theme background (contrast
by construction) with the image in a bordered panel.

- **Timing**: omit `duration` and provide `narration` for audio-driven scenes;
  `padding` (default 1.0s) adds a guaranteed tail buffer after narration.
- **Voice**: built-in voice slugs (list via `GET /v1/audio/voices`) or a
  cloned `voice_id` from a 2–3s audio sample.
- Full contract: `src/schema.json` (JSON Schema).

See `samples/sample-spec.json` for a complete example.

## Files

- `src/render.py` — spec → MP4 renderer (MoviePy + Matplotlib)
- `src/tts.py` — Mistral Voxtral TTS REST client (`/v1/audio/speech`)
- `src/schema.json` — JSON Schema for the spec
- `src/themes/presets.py` — dark/light color presets
- `demos/` — rendered example videos from `samples/sample-spec.json`

## Notes

- TTS is skipped gracefully (with a warning) when `MISTRAL_API_KEY` is unset.
- Never commit API keys; pass via environment only.

### Getting a Mistral API key

Students: request a key from your hackathon organiser.

- Free API access is not currently available from Mistral but the Pro (Education) option is very affordable if you wanted to sign up at [console.mistral.ai](https://console.mistral.ai)
- If you have a paid account, you can create a key under **API Keys**, copy it into your `.env`:
   `MISTRAL_API_KEY=...`
- Rate limits and model availability depend on your tier — see the
   **Limits** page in the console for your current allowances

## Contributing

Work happens on a branch in your fork **first**; the PR comes last.

1. **Fork** the repo, clone your fork, and create a branch: `git checkout -b your-feature`
2. **Pick an open issue** — issues are not exclusive; multiple teams may work the same one
3. **Build and test** — render the sample: `python3 src/render.py samples/sample-spec.json -o output/demo.mp4` (add your own `MISTRAL_API_KEY` in your fork under Settings → Secrets → Actions to run CI)
4. **Commit with co-author trailers** so teammates get credit: `Co-authored-by: Name <name@example.com>` (See `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` for instructions)
5. **Push your branch and open a PR** (`gh pr create`, or the web UI's Contribute button), referencing the issue (`Closes #N`) and attaching screenshot/video evidence as per the PR template

> CI runs on PRs but without access to repo secrets — test locally or in your fork with your own `MISTRAL_API_KEY` if your change touches TTS or image generation.
