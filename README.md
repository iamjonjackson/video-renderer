# video-renderer

Declarative video generation pipeline: describe scenes in a JSON spec, get an
MP4 with animated visuals, Mistral TTS (Voxtral) voiceover, and optional
background music.

## How it works

1. You provide a **spec** (JSON) — a timeline of scenes with text, charts,
   images, and optional narration.
2. The renderer synthesizes narration per scene via the Mistral TTS API,
   probes each clip's duration, and sizes each scene to its audio
   (audio-driven timeline). Explicit `duration` overrides when you want a
   scene to linger.
3. MoviePy composites the scenes with animations and encodes the final MP4.

## Running locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamjonjackson/video-renderer.git
cd video-renderer
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install moviepy matplotlib imageio-ffmpeg pillow

cp .env.example .env     # then edit .env and add your MISTRAL_API_KEY
set -a; source .env; set +a   # load env vars (or use dotenv in your shell)

# Final videos go to ./output, intermediate render files to ./temp
python3 src/render.py samples/sample-spec.json -o output/demo.mp4
```

Notes:
- `.env` is gitignored; `.env.example` documents the variables.
- `output/` (final videos) and `temp/` (TTS/image caches, intermediate
  artifacts) are gitignored except their `.gitkeep` placeholders.
- Without `MISTRAL_API_KEY`, scenes render silently and AI image blocks are
  skipped with a warning — the pipeline never hard-fails on missing AI.
- System ffmpeg is used if installed; otherwise `imageio-ffmpeg` bundles one.

### GitHub Actions

A `Render test` workflow runs on PRs: renders `samples/sample-spec.json`
using the `MISTRAL_API_KEY` repo secret and uploads the MP4 as an artifact.

## Spec format (summary)

```json
{
  "meta":  { "fps": 30 },
  "theme": { "preset": "dark", "accent": "#58a6ff" },
  "voice": { "slug": "gb_jane_neutral" },
  "music": { "src": "assets/music.mp3", "volume": 0.2 },
  "timeline": [
    { "type": "title",  "text": "Quarterly Review", "narration": "..." },
    { "type": "bullets", "heading": "Key Wins", "items": ["...", "..."] },
    { "type": "chart",  "chart_type": "bar", "labels": ["Jul","Aug","Sep"],
                        "values": [410, 455, 512], "narration": "..." },
    { "type": "image",  "src": "assets/slide.png", "anim": "kenburns" },
    { "type": "outro",  "text": "Thank you" }
  ]
}
```

- **Scene types**: `title`, `bullets`, `chart` (bar/line/pie), `image`, `outro`
- **Animations**: `fade`, `slide-up`, `zoom-in`, `kenburns` (images)
- **PPTX export**: every render also emits a `.pptx` alongside the MP4 —
  one slide per scene, built from the same artifacts (narration WAVs
  embedded on their slides, chart PNGs, generated images). Open in
  PowerPoint, tweak, and export to video from there for a near-identical
  result.
- **AI-generated images** (optional, any scene): add an `image` block —

```json
"image": {
  "prompt": "minimal isometric illustration of a rocket launch, deep blue palette",
  "placement": "background"   // "background" (faded, behind text) or
                               // "left" / "right" (spotlight panel beside text)
  "opacity": 0.25,             // background mode: image fade level
  "model": "mistral-medium-latest" // optional agent model override
}
```

For `background` placement the renderer measures WCAG contrast of the text
area against the composited backdrop and raises the scrim opacity until
AA (≥ 4.5:1) is met. If the target can't be reached even at maximum scrim,
the render continues with a warning (best-effort) — it never aborts.
`left`/`right` placements keep text on the solid theme background (contrast
by construction) with the image in a bordered panel.
- **Timing**: omit `duration` and provide `narration` for audio-driven scenes;
  `padding` (default 1.0s) adds a guaranteed tail buffer after narration.
- **Voice**: built-in voice slugs (list via `GET /v1/audio/voices`) or a
  cloned `voice_id` from a 2–3s audio sample.
- Full contract: `src/schema.json` (JSON Schema).

See `samples/sample-spec.json` for a complete example.

## Files

- `src/render.py` — spec → MP4 renderer (MoviePy + Matplotlib)
- `src/tts.py` — Mistral Voxtral TTS REST client (`/v1/audio/speech`)
- `src/schema.json` — JSON Schema for the spec
- `src/themes/presets.py` — dark/light color presets
- `demos/` — rendered example videos from `samples/sample-spec.json`

## Notes

- TTS is skipped gracefully (with a warning) when `MISTRAL_API_KEY` is unset.
- Never commit API keys; pass via environment only.

### Getting a Mistral API key

1. Sign up at [console.mistral.ai](https://console.mistral.ai) — a free tier
   is available for prototyping
2. Create a key under **API Keys**, copy it into your `.env`:
   `MISTRAL_API_KEY=...`
3. Rate limits and model availability depend on your tier — see the
   **Limits** page in the console for your current allowances

## Contributing

1. **Fork** the repo, then clone your fork and branch: `git checkout -b your-feature`
2. **Pick an open issue** from the [issue tracker](https://github.com/iamjonjackson/video-renderer/issues) and reference it in your PR (`Closes #N`)
3. **Test locally** — render the sample: `python3 src/render.py samples/sample-spec.json -o output/demo.mp4`
4. **Open a PR** from your fork's branch, including screenshot/video evidence of the working change (see the issue's acceptance criteria)

> CI runs on PRs but without access to repo secrets, so TTS/image steps are skipped in CI — test locally with your own `MISTRAL_API_KEY` if your change touches them.
